# Summary
## Rayguard is a simple tower defense game where the player defends against waves of enemies by placing various types of towers along a set path. 

# Core Gameplay
## The player will start with 100 gold at the begining of the game 
- Players place towers along a path to prevent enemies from reaching their base.
- There will be set positions where the player can place towers on.
- Each tower has different attack speeds and do varying damage.
- Players earn in-game currency for killing enemies, which they use to upgrade towers or place more towers.

# Towers

|Basic Enemy |Low health, easy to kill|25g| 
|Fast Enemy |Moves quickly but has low health|50g|
|Tanky Enemy|High heath but moves slow|75g|






# Objective
 Prevent enemies from reaching the end of the path. The game ends when the playerâ€™s base is destroyed.

# Graphics
We plan on using sprites 

Enemies: Simple sprite-based enemies with unique colors or shapes for each type (e.g., green for basic enemies, red for fast enemies).

Background and Path: The path will be a simple path or line with a basic background (e.g., grass, mountains).

UI: Basic HUD with health, money, and wave number displayed.




Gameplay Loop:

The game starts by generating a wave of enemies.

The player places towers, which automatically shoot at enemies in range.

Enemies walk along a path and lose health when hit by towers.

If an enemy reaches the end of the path, the player loses health.

The game continues through waves until the player runs out of health.

6. Game Economy
Currency System:
Players earn money for killing enemies, which can be used to buy towers.




(Probably not 
Upgrades: Players can upgrade their towers with additional damage or range for a higher cost.)
